# Understanding Gradle â€“ Video Series

This repository contains sample projects and further information on my [Understanding Gradle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxACdAdoVVimgPoFwbdHUkQ) video series.

The series introduces the concepts of Gradle one by one in short videos.
Rather than explaining each feature in detail, the series initially aims at explaining fundamental concepts and patterns.
This gives you a general understanding of how things work in Gradle and enables you to structure your project in a readable and maintainable way.
