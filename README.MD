# Understanding Gradle â€“ Video Series

This repository contains sample projects and further information on my [Understanding Gradle](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWQK2ZdV4Yl2k2OmC_gsjDpdIBTN0qqkE) video series.

The series introduces the concepts of the [Gradle Build Tool](https://github.com/gradle/gradle) one-by-one in short videos.
Rather than explaining each feature in detail, the series initially aims at explaining fundamental concepts and patterns.
This gives you a general understanding of how things work in Gradle and enables you to structure your project in a readable and maintainable way.
