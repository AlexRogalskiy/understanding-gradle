In the very first instalment of my *Understanding Gradle* series I talk about the entry point of every Gradle project - the Settings File.

## Gradle User Manual references

Each video only scratches the surfaces of the features shown.
This is on purpose to give you a general understanding of how things work in Gradle.
This understanding enables you to structure your project in a readable and maintainable way.

More details on each feature covered in this video can be found in the Gradle User Manual.
The Manual, however, is very detailed on all kinds of topics and also contains information on legacy features (it's not always clear which these are).

To help you find the right places, here are some deep links into the Manual on the topics discussed in the video:

* [Declaring Repositories](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html#sub:centralized-repository-declaration)
* [Plugin Repositories](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:custom_plugin_repositories)
* [Including Builds (Composite Builds)](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html)
* [Defining Subprojects (Multi-project builds)](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html)
